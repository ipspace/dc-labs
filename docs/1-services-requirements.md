# Define the Services and Requirements

You have to design a new data center infrastructure that will support the emerging needs of your organization. This hands-on assignment is the first step in that process.

Use your existing environment if youâ€™re an end-user, the environment of one of your customers, or maybe a sample project you were asked to work on and document the service requirements:

* What services will the new data center offer?
* How will the users consume the services?
* What level of self-provisioning and automation will you offer?
* Will the users deploy application stacks themselves?
* Will they manage their own security and network services?
* Disaster recovery requirements.

Based on these requirements, try to estimate the infrastructure requirements:

* Number of servers and storage nodes;
* Security- and network services needed to support the user requirements;
* Storage access technology;
* Required number of network ports;
* Estimated network bandwidth (internal and external);
* Virtual networking needs;
* IP address mobility requirements.
