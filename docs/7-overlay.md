# Design an Overlay Virtual Network Fabric

ACME Inc (see the previous design assignment for more details on their data center design) has successfully virtualized all their compute workloads and wants to migrate from the existing layer-2 data center fabric to an overlay virtual networking solution based on VMware NSX.

At the same time, they want to replace the existing firewall appliances with virtual firewalls, replacing each firewall context with a dedicated virtual firewall.

**Note:** While most applications don’t require a redundant virtual firewall solution, a few mission-critical applications do.

Design an overlay virtual networking solution for ACME Inc. and redesign the physical fabric to support the overlay virtual networking.
