# Building Next-Generation Data Center

Networking engineers attending the [Building Next-Generation Data Center](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center) online course had to solve several design assignments, including:

* [Define the Services and Requirements](1-services-requirements.md)
* [Design a Storage Solution](4-storage.md)
* [Build a Small Data Center Fabric](5-small-fabric.md)
* [Design a Robust Layer-2 Fabric](6-robust-layer-2-fabric.md)
* [Design an Overlay Virtual Network Fabric](7-overlay.md)
* [Extend a Leaf-and-Spine Fabric](11-extend-fabric.md)

I reviewed every single solution submitted by the course attendees. I can't do the same for everyone else, but you might still want to try to solve at least some of the challenges.
